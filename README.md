# 🎓 Accelerated Numerical Linear Algebra (NLA) & Optimization (OPT) Study Guide

Welcome to the **Accelerated NLA & OPT Study Guide**—a bespoke, highly interactive, and premium educational web application built to master advanced concepts in **Numerical Linear Algebra** and **Mathematical Optimization** with maximum retention and speed.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **🚀 Accelerated Learning Experience**: This interactive guide was custom-built to help me learn and master these complex mathematical and computational topics **significantly faster** than traditional methods. By transforming static lecture notes into dynamic, chunked modules, active recall quizzes, and a searchable progress-tracked formula hub, it has dramatically compressed my learning curve.
> 
> **🤖 Created with Antigravity**: This entire portal was co-created, coded, and iterated from scratch in collaboration with **Antigravity (by Google DeepMind)**, a cutting-edge agentic AI coding assistant. By combining advanced AI capabilities with developer intent, we built a fully-featured React + TypeScript + Vite portal with beautiful animations and a database backend in record time!

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Node.js** (v18+) and **npm** installed on your system.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository** (once pushed/published):
   `ash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/nla-opt-guide.git
   cd nla-opt-guide
   `

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   `ash
   npm install
   `

3. **Run the Development Server**:
   `ash
   npm run dev
   `
   *The app will be available locally at http://localhost:5173.*

4. **Build for Production**:
   `ash
   npm run build
   `
   *This compiles the TypeScript files and outputs a highly optimized production bundle to the dist/ directory.*
